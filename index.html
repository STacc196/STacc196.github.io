    <h1>An old snack</h1>
    <p>
        The World Wrestling Entertainment (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE">WWE</a>) used to have ice cream bars.<br>
        As a kid I remember eating them after school, but after the 3rd grade or so I started walking home and before I knew it, the WWE ice cream <br>
        bar had disappeared from my mind. After looking it up recently I've found out that it was <strong>discontinued</strong> around 2009, but it seems like it <br>
        has made a resurgence recently.
